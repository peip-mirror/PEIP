<h2>WHAT?</h2>

PEIP is a pure PHP Middleware Framework to easily create Messaging- and Work-Flows.<br>
One of PEIP's goals is to provide implementations of <a href="http://www.eaipatterns.com/eaipatterns.html">Enterprise Integration Patterns</a> for PHP (but take them a step further).<br>
PEIP can be used by scripting or configuration (recommended).<br>
PEIP is noninvasive - it plays nicely and intergrates with your favorite MVC, Library, Services or PHP Applications.<br> 
PEIP itself (contrary to any other Messaging Framework) is Event Driven. This allows for easily combining it's components without a need for coupling.<br> 
PEIP's Event Objects are first class Messages and can travel through the same components as Generic Messages.<br> 
PEIP can be easily extended and integrated (by using its interfaces).<br>
PEIP's configuration (ability) can be easily augmented by simple plugins.
